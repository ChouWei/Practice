git config --system core.longpaths true <------------------

process is running and remove the file manually to continue.


rm -f ./.git/index.lock<-----------------------------

In Unix systems the end of a line is represented with a line feed (LF). In windows a line is represented with a carriage return (CR) and a line feed (LF) thus (CRLF). when you get code from git that was uploaded from a unix system they will only have a LF. It's nothing to worry about.

And if you want to turn this warning off, type this in the git command line


git config --global core.autocrlf  false<-----------------------------
